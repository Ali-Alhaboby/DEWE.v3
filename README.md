# DEWE.v3

DEWE v3 is a serverless workflow execution framework with Function as a Service (FaaS) as the target execution environment. DEWE v3 is designed to address problems of (1) execution of large-scale scientific workflows and (2) resource underutilization. At its core is our novel hybrid (Function as a Service or FaaS and dedicated/local clusters) job dispatching approach taking into account resource consumption patterns of different phases of workflows execution. We have evaluated DEWE v3 on both AWS Lambda and Google Cloud Functions and demonstrate that FaaS offers an ideal solution for scientific workflows with complex precedence constraints.
